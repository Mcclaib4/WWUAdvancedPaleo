1.  **Conduct a GPA on your data and examine the plot. What information does it visualize?**
The GPA plots all the collected data and provides an averaged location for each landmark.

2.  **What does this information tell you about the original set of Osteostracan skulls?**
The data indicates that specimen dimensions vary considerably.

3.  **According to the plot, which two specimens are LEAST similar in terms of PC 1?**
Specimens 8 and 29 are the least similar in terms of PC1.

4.  **Embed the ````R .png ```` files for these two specimens in your MarkDown file and describe the visual differences between them. What factor does PC 1 seem to describe?**

5.  **According to the plot, which two specimens are least similar in terms of PC 2?**

6.  **Embed these images in your MarkDown file and describe the visual differences between them. What factor does PC 2 seem to describe?**

7.  **Create a simple bar plot of the proportion of variance and embed the figure in your Markdown file.**

8.  **Try plotting PC 1 and PC 18. Include the code that you used in your MarkDown file, and embed the resuting plot. Why does it look like all the specimens fall almost perfectly along a single line parallel to the major axis?**
